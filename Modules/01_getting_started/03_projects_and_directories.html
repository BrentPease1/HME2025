<h4 class="date">updated on 2022-12-20</h4>



<p>Everything that follows in this tutorial should be a viewed as
<em>suggestions</em> for how to organize your data, code, and results.
These suggestions are based on hard-won lessons from my own work as well
as advice from people who spend a lot of time thinking about efficient
and reproducible workflows. The lessons below are unabashedly R/RStudio
focused. However, they are just suggestions. There are many other ways
of accomplishing these objectives so you are free to use whatever
workflow works best for you. Even if you choose to use different
workflows or tools that are not as R-focused, hopefully the concepts
presented here will help make your process more efficient and
organized.</p>
<div id="common-workflows-and-their-problems" class="section level1">
<h1>Common workflows and their problems</h1>
<p>A common workflow used by many novice R users goes something like
this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open RStudio</p></li>
<li><p>Create a script and save it as
<code>analysis_for_my_project.R</code></p></li>
<li><p>Start the script with:</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">rm</span>(<span class="at">list =</span> <span class="fu">ls</span>())</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">setwd</span>(<span class="st">&quot;C:\Users</span><span class="sc">\b</span><span class="st">pease\path\specific</span><span class="sc">\t</span><span class="st">o\my\machine&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(package1)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(package2)</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a bunch of objects and do stuff to them:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">10</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>y <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">&quot;cheese&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Start googling around because you are stuck on some code. Paste
in Stack Overflow suggestions with generic object names.</p></li>
<li><p>Get confused about what objects in your current environment were
created by which script</p></li>
<li><p><code>rm(list = ls())</code> to start from scratch</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse and repeat</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="whats-wrong-with-this" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s wrong with this?</h2>
<p>Remember that when you open R, you create a <em>global
workspace</em>. This is where all of the objects you create get stored.
If you type <code>ls()</code> you can see everything that is currently
stored in your workspace. If you are working on different analyses in
the same global environment, it is <em>very</em> easy to accidentally
create different objects with the same name, write code that depends on
other code that happens to have been run previously during one R session
(for example, you loaded a needed package in one script so didn’t add
<code>library(package)</code> to your next script. What happens when you
try to run this code the next time? This often called a “hidden
dependency” and can make your life very pretty miserable), and many
other confusing behaviors.</p>
<p>This workflow also makes it very difficult to share your work.
Remember that R will default to looking in/saving to the current working
directory. To control this behavior, most people are taught to use
<code>setwd()</code>. The problem with this is that the path you set
using <code>setwd()</code> is almost certainty specific to the computer
your used to write that code. If you use a different computer later or
send code to your adviser for help, they will not be able to run it
without changing the working directory. If you move the files to a new
place on your computer, all of your code will break. Got a new computer?
Oops, none of your code will work anymore. If you are running multiple
analyses in the same R session, you’ll also have to constantly change
your working directory, which eventually will lead to confusion and
problems rerunning code. Manually setting the working directory seems
like a minor annoyance but if you have to do it constantly (for example,
an instructor who has to grade a bunch of homework assignments), these
minor annoyances add up to a big headache.</p>
<p>The good news is, there’s an easy solution that will make your life
(and mine) much easier.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="rstudio-projects" class="section level1">
<h1>RStudio Projects</h1>
<p>Experienced programmers learned long ago the problems outlined above.
To solve these problems, they typically use a self-contained directory
(i.e., folder) for each project. Each directory contains all of the data
and code needed to create research output for that project. Notably, the
code should not reference <em>any</em> data or objects that are found in
another directory. This helps ensure portability - you can move the
entire project and still be able to rerun all code.</p>
<p>RStudio makes is very easy to create Projects (for clarity, I will
use “Project” when referring specifically to RStudio Projects and
“project” to refer to generic research projects, i.e., a chapter of your
dissertation). I highly recommend that you create a new Project for each
project that are working on. There are several ways to do this but the
easiest way is to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open RStudio</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <code>File -&gt; New Project</code> then click
<code>New Directory</code> (if you already have a folder associate with
the project, you can click <code>Existing Directory</code> and then
navigate to that folder)</p></li>
<li><p>Click <code>New Project</code> then choose a name and a location
for the Project (tip - don’t include spaces in the project name). For
now we will not worry about creating a git repository or using
packrat</p></li>
<li><p>Click <code>Create Project</code> at the bottom. RStudio will
create a new directory with the same name as your Project and a file
called <code>project_name.Rproj</code> inside of that
directory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A new RStudio window should open when you create the new project. In
the future, when you want to work on this Project, just double click the
<code>project_name.Rproj</code> file and it will open a new instance of
RStudio.</p>
<div id="whats-so-special-about-rstudio-projects" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s so special about RStudio Projects?</h2>
<p>Projects solve two of the big problems we discussed earlier. First,
each project opens a fresh instance of R so the global environment of
projects is self-contained. That means you can you have multiple
projects open at once but each one will behave independently. This means
no more <code>rm(list = ls())</code> because the only objects in your
environment should be the ones associated with that project (this
doesn’t totally resolve the problem of hidden dependencies but we’ll
talk more about that below).</p>
<p>Second, RStudio will automatically set the working directory to the
root directory associate with the Project. This means that whatever
folder the <code>.Rproj</code> file is in will automatically be set as
the working directory when you open the project. You can check this by
typing <code>getwd()</code> in the console of your new project. This
setting avoids the need to use <code>setwd()</code> which makes your
code much more portable. You can move or send the entire directory,
double-click the <code>.Rproj</code> file and pick up right where you
left off.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-note-on-saving-your-workspace-to-.rdata" class="section level2">
<h2>A note on saving your workspace to <code>.RData</code></h2>
<p>Another common mistake made by many novice (and not so novice) R
users is to save your current workspace to <code>.RData</code> each time
you quit R or RStudio. On the surface, this seems like a really
convenient shortcut. The next time you open R, all of the objects you
created previously are right there waiting for you to keep going!</p>
<p>The problem is that, again, this creates hidden dependencies. The
<code>.RData</code> file does not re-load packages that you were using
in your previous session. It does not re-set options that you may have
set in your previous session (<code>setwd()</code>,
<code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code>). Some objects needed for, e.g.,
making a figure may be loaded but others may not be. This means that
even if you saved your workspace, you will still end up needing to
re-run some chunks of code to get back to where you left off previously.
Which chunks? Who knows. You probably think you’ll remember but you
won’t.</p>
<p>A better workflow is to start every R session with an empty
workspace. This means you go into each session with the mindset that you
will need to re-run all code from scratch every time. Although this
seems like a pain, I promise it will make your life easier. It is a way
of <em>ensuring</em> that at a minimum, you can reproduce all of your
analyses anytime you need to.</p>
<p>In RStudio, you can enforce this workflow by going to
<code>RStudio -&gt; Tools -&gt; Global Options</code> and then in the
<code>General</code> tab setting
<code>Save workspace to .Rdata on exit</code> to <code>Never</code>.
Highly recommended.</p>
<p>What about re-running code that is very time consuming? Do you really
need to re-run the code the cleans your raw data every time you need to
reanalyze it? Of course not. You can always save those objects (along
with the scripts you used to create them!) so that the next time you
need them, they can just be re-read into R and you can do everything
downstream of those steps without a problem. We’ll see example of this
as we work through data cleaning and analysis scripts throughout the
semester.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of this workflow is that it treats your raw data
and code as the only <em>real</em> objects in your workflow. These
should be the only objects that if you lose them, you would be in big
trouble (you’re computer is backed up, right?). Cleaned data that you
created from your raw data isn’t real. You can just re-run the code and
create those objects again (this is why we use R scripts instead of
manipulating raw data in excel. See below for more details). Your
workspace isn’t real - as we just discussed, it can (and should)
disappear at any time. Results and figures are not real because you can
re-create them from the code whenever you need to. Once you get into
this mindset of treating raw data and code as the only real objects,
your workflow will automatically become more organized and reproducible.
(Manuscripts are also real so save them and back them up!)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="organizing-your-project-directories" class="section level1">
<h1>Organizing your project directories</h1>
<p>As we already saw, the <code>.Rproj</code> file treats the directory
that it is in as the working directory for that project. This means that
you can read files from this location and write files to this location
without changing any settings. For example, you can stick a filled
called <code>data.csv</code> in this directory and the following code
will work:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read.csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;data.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A natural instinct for those of us that are inclined to be less-than
organized might be to put all of our files associated the project in
this directory:</p>
<pre><code>my_proj/
|─── data.csv
|─── script_that_does_everything.R
|─── test_script_that_does_something_else.R
|─── Figure1.png
|─── manuscript_v1.doc
|─── manuscript_v2.doc
.
.
.
|─── manuscript_final_v2-4.doc</code></pre>
<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with this but for most project, you
will end up with a very big directory that is hard to navigate when you
need to find specific files. A better idea is to put files in intuitive
subdirectories. You can pick whatever structure makes most sense to you,
but I generally use something like:</p>
<pre><code>my_proj/
|─── data/
      |─── data.csv
      |─── more_data.csv
|─── scripts/
      |─── 01_prep.R
      |─── 02_analysis.R
|─── results/
      |─── cool_result.rds
      |─── extra_cool_result.rds
|─── figures/
      |─── fig1.png
      |─── fig2.png</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><code>data/</code> contains my, you guessed it, data files (CSVs,
shapefiles, etc). These data files are read into scripts for processing,
analyzing, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>scripts/</code> contains R scripts used to analyze data,
make figures, whatever. These could be put in the subdirectory related
to the function of the script if that makes more sense to you, or name
the file such that it tells you its function. Any grouping/ordering is
fine, as long as it makes sense to you and you know how to find it when
you need it.</p></li>
<li><p><code>results/</code> contains output from any scripts that may
be used in other scripts for further analyses.</p></li>
<li><p><code>figures/</code> contains figure files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I have seen more and less complicated folder structures, but the
above has worked well for me. If there are more folders, it usually is
for intermediate steps.</p>
<div id="readingwriting-from-subdirectories" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading/writing from subdirectories</h2>
<p>Because RStudio treats the project root directory as the working
directory, you could not do the following if, for example, your data is
stored in a subdirectory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read.csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;data.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Instead, you need to use relative paths. Remember that everything is
relative to your working directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read.csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;data-raw/data.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you prefer, you can have as many layers of subdirectories as you
want. The important thing is that as long as you move the entire project
directory, these relative paths will still work. One note is that, in
rare cases, the path with the final file name can get too long and throw

<h2>A note on handling raw data</h2>
<p>Raw data is sacred. If you purposely or accidentally change your raw
data, everything that comes downstream (analysis, results, reports) will
also change. To maintain the integrity of your work, get in the habit of
<strong>never</strong> making changes to your raw data files after you
have entered the data.</p>
<p>One of the great things about using scripts to manipulate your data
is that you can leave your raw data untouched and have a paper trail of
every change you made to prepare your data for analysis. That means
adding new variables that are composites of the raw data (e.g.,
<code>temp_c &lt;- (temp_f -32)*(5/9)</code>), removing outliers,
joining different data sets together, whatever. <em>All of this is done
in R after you’ve read in the raw data rather than in Excel!</em></p>
<p>Just as important, you don’t save these new data objects over the raw
data or even in the same directory. Those files go in
<code>results/</code> folder or, perhaps an <code>output/</code> folder
to hold intermediate objects. This means you can only read from the
<code>data/</code> and you cannot write to it. R will, of course, allow
you to write to <code>data/</code>, this is just a suggestion to help
you maintain a firewall that will keep you raw data in it’s raw
form.</p>
